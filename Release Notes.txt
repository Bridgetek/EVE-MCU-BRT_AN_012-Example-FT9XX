Restrictions:
- This release will support FT9xx Toolchain version V2.5.0 and later. Older toolchain versions are not supported due to an API change in the usbd.c library file.

Known issues:
- When building in Eclipse, the build process will sometimes stop with the message:
        make: *** Access is denied.
        .  Stop.
        make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
	Or build may slow down with messages for anti-virus scanning of the toolchain's ft32-elf-*.exe files. 
  This is a known issue with some antivirus software, such as AVG.
  Workarounds include (depending on the antivirus software):
	- Temporary disable the antivirus software 
	- Add exceptions to every "exe/bat" under the "<installation folder>\Toolchain\tools\*" folder

Fixed issues:
- Support usbd.c API in toolchain V2.5.0 and above.

Feature requests:
- None.
